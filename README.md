# NewsPapers

This project is about to display recent articles from the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/docs/get-started).

Also it's the occasion to try the new release Angular v12 and the new [Angular DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/angular-devtools/ienfalfjdbdpebioblfackkekamfmbnh?hl=fr).

To help me to develop this project, I used [Material Angular](https://material.angular.io/).

The aim of this application is to progress my skills with Angular Framework.

## Skills developed

- Use a free api with a secret key

- Read and understand the documentation of the api

- New way of writing scss

- Handle passing data with state with the router.navigation

- New way to set http params with new HttpParams.set(param, 'value');

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
